# Arduino Core for Bouffalo's RISC-V MCU (BL808) modules and boards.
This is a community made Arduino Core specifically for the Bouffalo Labs BL808 RISC-V MCUs. The intention here is to make this core compatible with AVR and ESP32/ESP8266 Arduino Cores for easy migrating of existing projects. It's modeled on the work done by Earle F. Philhower, III over at the [arduino-pico](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) project.
# Supported MCUs
- [X] BL808
# Supported Boards
* PINE64 Ox64
* Sipeed MAIX M1s Dock
