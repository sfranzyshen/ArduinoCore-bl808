### Arduino Core for Bouffalo Lab's RISC-V SOC (BL808) modules and boards.
This is a community made Arduino Core specifically for the Bouffalo Labs BL808 RISC-V SOCs. The intention here is to make this core compatible with AVR and ESP32/ESP8266 Arduino Cores for easy migrating of existing projects. It's modeled on the work done by Earle F. Philhower, III over at the [arduino-pico](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico) project.
