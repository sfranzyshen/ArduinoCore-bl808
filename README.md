# Arduino Core for Bouffalo Lab's RISC-V MCU (BL808) modules and boards.
This is a community made Arduino Core specifically for the Bouffalo Labs BL808 RISC-V MCUs. The intention here is to make this core compatible with AVR and ESP32/ESP8266 Arduino Cores for easy migrating of existing projects. It's modeled on the work done by Earle F. Philhower, III over at the [arduino-pico](https://github.com/earlephilhower/arduino-pico), the Sipeed's [Maixduino](https://github.com/sipeed/Maixduino), and the Pine64 [ArduinoCore-bouffalo](https://github.com/pine64/ArduinoCore-bouffalo) projects.
